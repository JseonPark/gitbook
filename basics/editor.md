### Writing content

GitBook offers a range of block types for you to add to your content inline — from simple text and tables, to code blocks and more. These elements will make your pages more useful to readers, and offer extra information and context.

Either start typing below, or press `/` to see a list of the blocks you can insert into your page.

### Reusable Contents

Reusable contents in GitBook are pre-defined blocks that can be reused across multiple pages or locations in your documentation. This feature helps maintain consistency and saves time by allowing you to manage and update content centrally. Simply create a reusable block once, and insert it wherever needed.



### Defining Reusable Contents in GitBook



1. **Create a Reusable Block:**
   * Navigate to the section of your documentation where you want to define reusable content.
   * Use the insert block menu by pressing `/` and select the block type.
2. \*\*





In GitBook, the `<` symbol is not a function but often initiates HTML tags or Markdown syntax to format text, such as `<b>` for bold or `<i>` for italics when editing a document. It may also appear in custom block functions to define or apply specific formatting or functionality within the GitBook editor.

The `<` symbol is often used to indicate the start of an HTML tag or a markdown function, but it's not specifically used for creating reusable contents in GitBook. In GitBook, reusable content is created using blocks and is inserted by using the insert block menu, typically accessed by pressing the `/` key.

Yes, you can define reusable content by creating and managing reusable blocks within your GitBook documentation. Utilize the insert block menu by pressing `/` and selecting the appropriate block type to define reusable content that can be inserted and edited throughout your documents.
